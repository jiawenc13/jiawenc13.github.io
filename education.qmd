Hi! My name is Jia. I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Business Studies degree specialised in Data Analytics, from Dublin City University. I have a strong interest in the field of data analytics and is curious of how analytics can make a change to the world. During the course of my studies, I have gained knowledge on multiple business aspects including marketing, supply chain management and operations management, and had hands on experiences on several programming tools like SQL, Power BI and Python. During my college journey, I've also had the privilege to take part in the Dragon Dens presentation, where we get to learn and experience of just an overview of what it takes to become an entrepreneur. With a strong foundation in both business and analytics field, I believe that I can bridge the gap between technical insights and strategic decision-making, ultimately contributing to more informed, efficient, and impactful business solutions.

As part of my course in Business Studies, I had the opportunity to go on INTRA, a year-long internship program that provided valuable hands-on experience in a professional environment. Throughout the placement, I have developed key professional skills from building a strong CV and tackling through interviews, to working effectively in a professional environment. 

My internship took place at Research Ireland, a funding organisation that supports researchers in the STEM fields in Ireland. I worked in the Programme Operations department, where I gained valuable, multifaceted experience across both administrative and logistical tasks. Throughout the internship, I had the opportunity to work with a range of tools, including Microsoft Excel, Word, Tableau and the company's grants and awards management system, which helped strengthen my technical and organizational skills in a professional setting. This role has allowed me to develop a well-rounded understanding of internal operations, while also strengthening my time management skills, stakeholder engagement, and ability to adapt to a dynamic work environment. I gained confidence in both collaborative teamwork and taking individual responsibility for tasks and projects.
