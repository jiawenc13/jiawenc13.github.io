Hi! My name is Jia. I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Business Studies degree specialised in Data Analytics, from Dublin City University. I have a strong interest in the field of data analytics and is curious of how analytics can make a change to the world. During the course of my studies, I have gained knowledge on multiple business aspects including marketing, supply chain management and operations management, and had hands on experiences on several programming tools like SQL, Power BI and Python. During my college journey, I've also had the privilege to take part in the Dragon Dens presentation, where we get to learn and experience of just an overview of what it takes to become an entrepreneur. With a strong foundation in both business and analytics field, I believe that I can bridge the gap between technical insights and strategic decision-making, ultimately contributing to more informed, efficient, and impactful business solutions.
