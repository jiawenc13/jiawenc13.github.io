Throughout the creation of this ePortfolio, I’ve gained hands-on experience with Quarto and GitHub as a first-time user. I learned the difference between CSS and SCSS, and how they can be used to style and customise the look of a website. I also explored how to structure and present project contents using Quarto’s listing feature. Toward the end of the process, I became more confident in using Git, particularly understanding how to use git commit, git push, and quarto render effectively. These technical skills have not only helped me complete this project but will also support me in future development tasks.

This project helped me improve in several areas:

Problem-solving skills: One major challenge I encountered was a deployment issue where my “Projects” page showed a 404 “File Not Found” error after pushing the site to GitHub. At first, I panicked, but I eventually stayed calm and investigated into the issue logically. First, I researched about the 404 error and found that it the issue may ly on the link/address of the "Projects" page. Then I checked my folder structures and listings, and suspected that the issue may lay at the extra 'list' subfolder under the "Projects" folder. However, after moving the subfolder, the issues persisted. I then checked my GitHub repositories and looked through the folders and files I have. I eventaully realised that the issue lies the case-sensitive folder name. The "Projects" folder within the /docs folder have an uppercase 'P', although the .qmd file from vscode was normal with lowercase. I've taken several approaches to solve this issue, however, the changes from my .qmd was still not reflected in the /docs folder. Ultimately, I have decided to re-name the folder to 'projects_temp' to let Quarto recognise and distinguish between similar folder names.

Time management: Reflecting honestly, I recognise that my poor time management could have been improved. Organising my time and schedules well along with other assignment could've allowed me to have more time to enhance the website and explore more features pf Quarto. Going forward, with this learning experience, I believe I can better organise my time for the future.

Beyond the technical skills, this project taught me the importance of time management, problem-solving, and taking ownership of my learning process. I now feel more confident in working with development tools and publishing platforms than the very beginning of the semester and I will practise more during my free time and build on these skills in future projects.
