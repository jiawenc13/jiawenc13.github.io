I was born and raised here in Ireland, but my family is originally from China. In addition to speaking Chinese at home, I also spent five years living in China with my grandparents during my childhood. This experience helped me retain the language and cultural connection, and I’m grateful to still be able write in Chinese to some extent. Inspired by my grandfather, I’ve had a love for mathematics and a natural sensitivity to numbers from a young age. While I eventually chose to pursue a path in the business world, I never wanted to lose this knowledge. That’s why I decided to specialise in data analytics, a field that allows me to combine my analytical strengths with business insight, using statistics and data to drive meaningful and impactful decisions.

During my time at university, I’ve been actively involved in several clubs and societies, including the Badminton Society and Archery Society, which have allowed me to stay active, meet new people, and improve my communication and socialising skills. In addition, I was an Ordinary Committee Member of the Table Tennis Society during my final year. In this role, I’ve contributed to planning and decision-making during meetings, helped coordinate events, and assisted with the setup and smooth running of weekly sessions. This experience has significantly strengthened my communication, teamwork, and organisational skills, while also providing opportunities to build confidence in social and leadership settings.

### Hobbies and Interests

In my free time, I enjoy listening to music and singing, both of which allow me to unwind and express myself creatively. My favorite genre is R&B, its smooth melodies and emotional depth always catches my soul. Music has always been a big part of my life, and I'm currently learning to play the guitar, which has been a fun and rewarding challenge.

### Career Goals

Looking ahead, my career goal is to work in the field of data analytics, where I can apply my technical skills and business knowledge to support data-driven decision-making. While I have a strong interest in analytics, I do not limit myself to one specific industry. I consider myself a curious and adaptable individual who enjoys learning about new areas and tackling diverse challenges. Whether it’s in healthcare, technology, or an entirely different sector, I’m eager to explore how data can be used to solve problems, uncover insights, and drive meaningful impact to the world. In the long term, I hope to grow into a role where I can lead projects, collaborate with cross-functional teams, and continue evolving alongside the ever-changing landscape of data and business.
