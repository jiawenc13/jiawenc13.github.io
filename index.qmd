Hi! I'm Jia.

Welcome to my e-portfolio! This space is a reflection of my journey, experiences, and the skills I’ve developed throughout my time in college. Whether you’re here to explore my projects, learn more about my background, or just get a sense of who I am, I’m glad you stopped by. I’ve put this portfolio together to showcase not only what I’ve done, but how I approach challenges, collaborate with others, and continue growing in my field. Feel free to look around and I hope you find something that sparks your interest!
