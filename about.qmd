As part of my course, I had the opportunity to go on INTRA, a year-long internship program that provided valuable hands-on experience. My internship took place at Research Ireland, a funding organization that supports researchers in the STEM fields. I was based in the Programme Operations department, where I gained valuable, multifaceted experience across both administrative and logistical tasks. This role allowed me to develop a well-rounded understanding of internal operations, while also strengthening my attention to detail, stakeholder engagement, and ability to adapt to a dynamic work environment. Throughout the placement, I developed key professional skills from building a strong CV and tackling through interviews, to working effectively in a professional environment. I gained confidence in both collaborative teamwork and taking individual responsibility for tasks and projects.
