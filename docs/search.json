    "title": "Strong Roots Supply Chain Strategy Report",
    "section": "",
    "text": "üìÑ PDF\n\n\nExecutive Summary\nStrong Roots, an Irish plant-based frozen food company known for its healthy and sustainable frozen foods, has expanded into new markets across Ireland, UK, Europe, Asia and the US. Despite gaining a solid foothold in the global frozen food industry, it continues to face challenges that disrupt its supply chain. This essay will focus on the impact of climate change on Strong Roots‚Äô supply chain, identifying the current supply chain issues the company is facing. I will propose strategies through conducting researches, to help mitigate the climate-related challenges and outline an implementation timeline for the first year and a brief overview of implementation for second year. Finally, I will justify the proposed strategies by referencing supply chain theories and providing examples of how other companies have successfully implemented similar approaches.\n\n\nIntroduction\nStrong Roots is an Irish SME founded in 2015 which is known for producing plant-based, frozen and nutritious foods such as sweet potatoes fries, spinach bites and cauliflower hash brown. Strong Roots offers a wide range of vegan options (Strong Roots, no date) and centres its focus on producing high quality, healthy frozen foods. Starting off as a small local business, Strong Roots has now expanded its market across many countries in the UK, Europe, Asia and the US (Taylor, 2018). As the company is growing both domestically and internationally, tt must adapt its ingredients and sourcing practices to align with local food regulations and consumer preferences. Like the broader frozen food industry, Strong Roots faces challenges in logistics, material sourcing, and maintaining its sustainability goals. However, following its acquisition by McCain, the company may now have increased resources and capital to address these challenges more effectively.\n\n\nRisk Assessment ‚Äì Climate Change-Centred Supply Chain Challenges\nUnstable Agricultural Production\nStrong Roots emphasises complete transparency of its ingredients in the nutrition information provided to the customers (Strong Roots, no date). It is apparent that the company do not use any GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) as it serves its primary purpose of providing a healthier alternative to burgers, fried dishes and other frozen foods (Instacart, no date). Most of the vegetables and ingredients used by Strong Roots are sourced directly from farmers across different countries near their manufacturers. While this approach ensures the freshness and proximity of the ingredients, it poses the supply chain challenge due to unpredictable agricultural production. Extreme weather conditions such as storms, floods and droughts can interrupt crop growth and cause unexpected shortages, affecting ingredient availability (Prasad and Chakravorty, 2015).\nLogistical Disruptions\nRefrigerated foods are typically transported by sea and road to accommodate the low temperature needed to prevent the spoilage of the foods. Therefore, Strong Roots mainly relies on sea and road freights to deliver its raw materials and inventory (Global Research Consulting, 2023). For instances, the extreme lowering of water levels of some European rivers in summer 2022 (Limb, 2022) have hugely restricted the river freight capacity. This also led to an increased charge on road freights as the alternative transport option. Other conditions like extreme heatwaves can pose challenges of delaying the rail speed (Stugys, 2023) due to sun kink and raise issues of road cracking and other damage which eventually leads to an operational disruption of road freights (Stugys, 2023) which is one of the main modes of transport Strong Roots relies on. This disruption of supply chain logistics can ultimately lead to a higher cost of transportation affecting the efficiency and timeliness of inventory restocking.\nIncrease of Carbon Footprint\nOne of the main commitments of Strong Roots is to reduce carbon footprint (Strong Roots, no date). In its partnership with McCain in 2021, it can be seen that Strong Roots aligns with McCain‚Äôs commitment to sustainable practice, includes the implementing of generative agriculture (O‚ÄôSullivan, 2024). This has undoubtedly tackled a part of their sustainable goals. However, Strong Roots still faces greenhouse gas emissions challenge, mainly due to the heavy reliance on sea and road freights. As refrigerated truck are required to transport temperature-sensitive materials like vegetables (DHL Freight Connections, no date), it consumes more fuels than the standard trucks due to their cooling systems.\n\n\nProposed Strategic Plan to Tackle Climate Change Impact on Strong Roots\n\nInvestment of Hydroponics\n\nTo respond to the unstable agricultural production caused by extreme weather conditions, Strong Roots could invest into Hydroponics to ensure the stable sourcing of raw materials (i.e.¬†vegetables, etc). Hydroponics is the growing of plants using a ‚Äúwater-based nutrient solution‚Äù instead of soil (USDA, no date). With indoor hydroponics, the risk of disrupted crop production can be hugely reduced by preventing land degradation (eden green technologies, no date) and other damages and delays caused by extreme weather conditions (Rajendran et al., 2024). Hydroponics crops potentially reduce the level of contamination risk compared to soil-based farming which provides a more safe and healthy consumption (Rajendran et al., 2024) which allows the company to continue to strive its goal of providing heathy foods. While high capital is required to develop Strong Roots‚Äô own Hydroponics system, Strong Roots could leverage its acquisition by McCain Food company to explore partnerships with Hydroponic companies. Strong Roots could establish a long-term contract, securing sustainable facilities through an external partner without the immediate capital outlay of building its own system.\n\nInvestment of Vertical Farming\n\nVertical farming is the method of growing crops in vertically and horizontally stacked layers (eden green technologies, no date). In terms of addressing the climate change challenges Vertical Farming is conducted indoors and does not require soils or natural sunlight, hence it is not affected by weather conditions (Kalantari et al., 2017). Vertical Farming can also be an advantage towards countries with urban heat challenges (Kalantari et al., 2017) like the US, due to its nature of taking place indoor with artificial light source and soilless process. In terms of nutrition, produce from vertical farming does not contain any herbicides, pesticides, or artificial preservatives (Kalantari et al., 2017), aligning with the company goal of providing nutritious and healthy food options. Strong Roots can consider finding Vertical Farms in countries like the US, where such facilities are established, and develop a reliable supplier relationship to proactively prepared for weather disruptions.\n\nSupplier and Geographic Diversification\n\nAn approach to address the logistical disruption is to diversify the supplier geographically and fostering collaboration across multiple supply chain tiers. As Strong Roots have markets across different continents like the US, Europe, and Asia, the company should consider sourcing some ingredients like vegetables from different regions with less climate impact (Kittipanya‚Äêngam, Shi and Gregory, 2011). This enables Strong Roots to avoid relying on a single source of raw ingredients. For instance, when one supplier experience supply shortages, another supplier from a different region can fulfil the demand. Furthermore, Strong Roots should consider communicating and collaborating with both downstream and upstream logistics vendors. This enables the organisation to know where and how items are sourced, transported and processed, allowing it to take proactive measures to mitigate any potential risk.\n\nImplementation of Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO)\n\nWhile the approach of adopting Hydroponics and Vertical Farming have already reduced carbon emission to some extent, Strong Roots could further reduce its carbon emission by replacing fuels used by agricultural machinery or refrigerated truck, to Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO). HVO is a low-carbon biofuel which can directly replace the regular diesel and offers a more biodegradable, renewable and sustainable approach in transportation (Smigins et al., 2023). By taking this action, Strong Roots would be able to reduce the greenhouse emission significantly hence further promotes its sustainable reputation.\n\n\nImplementation Timeline\nThe following table is a suggested plan for Strong Roots for the first three years of the initial implementation of the strategies:\n\nYear 2\nIn Year 2, the company expect to have successfully secured the contract with HVO suppliers. Strong Roots should continue to maintain stable and constant communication with diverse region suppliers and should expect to secure contract in the regions that is most likely in need of alternative suppliers. Furthermore, the company should continue to look into the capital and investment side for the hydroponics system.\n\n\nJustification of Proposed Strategy\nInvesting in Hydroponics and Vertical Farming as a supply chain strategy aligns with the theory of Supply Chain Agility. Supply Chain Agility refers to the ability of a supply chain to respond quickly towards changes in supply or demand (Gligor et al., 2019). Agility focuses on efficiency and flexibility to changes in the market like consumer fluctuation (Sen, 2023) and the internal company environment, for instances, shortage of raw materials (Sen, 2023) caused by geopolitical threats or climate challenges. For instances, the supermarket chain Whole Foods Market (businesswire, 2023) partners with the vertical farm company Plenty to achieve a more sustainable approach in food (Radosavac, 2022), and also mitigating risk posed by unpredictable weather conditions. Supplier and geographic diversification relates to the Risk Pooling Theory of Supply Chain, meaning that the company distribute risk among several suppliers and geographical areas in order to mitigate the impact supply chain disruptions such as caused by extreme weather conditions (Yang and Schrage, 2009). An example of company is Nestl√© which adopted geographical diversification in their sourcing of raw materials like coffee beans in order to mitigate risk of supply shortages caused by climate disruptions (Nestl√©, no date). Lastly, the implementation of HVO follows the Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) framework (ASCM, no date).\n\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, Strong Roots‚Äô commitment to sustainability has undoubtedly an important factor in motiving it to solve supply chain challenges posed by climate change. With investment of time and capital in climate resilient sourcing, diversifying supplier and using sustainable alternatives, Strong Roots can establish a more adaptive, effective and efficient supply chain. While the performance of the strategies needs to be monitored continuously, by investing into the potential challenge, it allows Strong Roots to mitigate the likelihood of significant losses due to adverse climate conditions. This proactive approach ensures the company remains resilient and prepared for the potential disruptions.\n\n\n\n\nBibliography (Harvard 12th Ed.)\nStrong Roots (no date) Strong Roots | Our products, Strong Roots.

    "title": "Harvest City: The Intelligent Procurement System Project",
    "section": "",
    "text": "üìÑ PDF\n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\nThis report investigates the case study ‚ÄúHarvest City: The Intelligent Procurement System Project‚Äù by Applegate and Montealegre (2018), which aimed to integrate Internet of Things (IoT), sensors and cloud-based infrastructural technologies into the state-of-art management system in the most modern Harvest City in the midwestern U.S. Despite the innovative and ambitious vision, the project was a failure in achieving its ultimate objectives due to a series of issues in its management, strategic planning and vision alignment. The first half of the report identifies the key factors based on the case study, contributing to the project failure, and critically examines three core issues:\n\n\nLate integration of procurement system and misalignment with the construction schedule.\nUnexpected change in leadership and absence of strong governance.\nUncontrolled scope creep and lack of formal change management process.\n\n\nThese issues have ultimately led to delays of the grand opening, reputational damage due to safety incidents, and significant financial waste. The second half of the report proposes targeted recommendations to each of the core issues. These include the adoption of centralised management and formal review process, to utilising planning and analysis tools like the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Gantt Chart, Power-Interest Matrix to effectively mitigate conflicts and control risks.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Harvest City Intelligent Procurement System project was a large-scale technology initiative designed to automate and optimise the procurement of goods and services across the Harvest City Convention Centre Complex. The system plans to integrate Internet of Things (IoT), sensors, cloud-based infrastructure and real-time analytics to manage both direct and indirect items‚Äô procurement (Applegate and Montealegre, 2018). This system was set out to improve efficiencies and reduce cost in managing the operations across all tenants. However, this project was a failure. Due to many internal and external factors, it resulted in delays, loss of finance and damage to Harvest City‚Äôs reputation. In this report, I will identify the key factors contributing to the project‚Äôs failure and critically examine three main factors. Furthermore, I will propose recommendations referencing project management principles, which could have mitigated these issues and improved the project‚Äôs chance of success.\n\n\n\nKey Factors Contributing to Project Failure:\n\n\nLate integration and misalignment with construction schedule: Venso was brought into the project after construction had already begun, meaning that a lot of the completed or in-progress interior space had to be demolished for alternation required to incorporate Venso‚Äôs procurement system.\nLeadership changes & weak governance: Leadership responsibilities were later on dispersed across executive team members without a clear handover, instead of appointing a new leader. As the team is already overwhelmed with other aspects of the project, it caused unconsidered decision-making and poor coordination.\nLack of stakeholder alignment and communication: Miscommunication about the system requirements and approvals have caused significant interruptions to the installed system.\nScope creep and poor change management: Stakeholders constantly requested for changes to the system, even after the contract clearly stated that no changes would be permitted beyond specific deadlines. The contractual agreements were treated as flexible guidelines instead of binding commitments by the stakeholders.\nInadequate project oversight: The new executive team failed to recognise the critical role of the procurement system and treated it as a conventional infrastructure project instead of a complex and integrated technology project.\n\nNow, the report will delve into three core factors. \n\nLate Integration and Schedule Misalignment\n\nOne of the core issues contributed to Harvest City Intelligent Procurement System‚Äôs failure is the late integration of the system from the very beginning. Prior to the signing of the contract, Miller, the CEO of Venso, has clearly expressed that their intelligent procurement system could not be successfully integrated midway through a construction project, due to its technical complexity and the requirement for embedded infrastructure to support the IoT, sensors and other key components. However, despite the warnings, the contract still proceeded following the persuasion from Casper. This has resulted in multiple interior spaces in the complex to be demolished and rebuilt in order to incorporate the alterations, which caused a waste of both financial and physical resources. Furthermore, due to the scheduled completion of the project being a few weeks before the centre‚Äôs grand opening, it has given the centre no time to trial run and spot any errors beforehand, causing the huge incident of the event day. \n\nLeadership Changes and Weak Governance\n\nAnother key factor contributed to the project‚Äôs failure was the ineffective response towards unforeseen leadership change. After John Casper, the CEO of Harvest City Corporation resigned from his position due to illness, instead of hiring and appointing a new leader with the relevant expertise, the responsibilities were dispersed across the rest of the executive team, who are already overwhelmed with other duties. The team not only lacked technical expertise, but also failed to dedicate sufficient time and effort to fully understand the contract and the project‚Äôs scope. Furthermore, there was a clear lack of shared vision, as the executive team saw the project as a conventional infrastructure project instead of a core complex and integrated technology project that requires specialised support. This has equipped them with no capability to make optimal and effective decisions. As a result, critical issues raised by Venso were either delayed or ignored completely, which significantly affected the project‚Äôs ability to address challenges and to remain aligned with the original plans and vision. \n\nScope Creep and Poor Change Management\n\nThe third key factor that contributed to this project‚Äôs failure was the emergence of scope creep and the lack of effective change management. Despite the system design being finalised and the signed contract clearly stating that no further changes would be permitted after specific deadlines, many tenants and internal stakeholders continued to request for modifications. For example, the operating team requested a change which required demolition and reconstruction to the space. The catering vendor requested changes that required extra financial input. These change requests disrupted the original project plan and workflow, requiring additional actions that extended beyond the planned schedule. Since the original completion date was already close to the grand opening, time flexibility for incorporating changes were extremely limited. Moreover, complaints that were made at executive levels were all ignored meaning that implementations on change requests had to proceed, even without a formal review process and assessment carried out. As a result, these changes led to misalignment to the original deadline and compromised the system‚Äôs integrity. \n\n\nRecommendations\n\n\nImproving Project Planning and Integration Through Centralised Management, WBS and Gantt Chart\n\nTo address the issue of late integration and schedule misalignment, the Harvest City Intelligent Procurement System project should establish a centralised project management structure at the early phase of the project lifecycle. This means that all project management functions such as project planning, stakeholder management are managed by one central point (Jong and Faerman, 2020). This ensures that all activities and decisions carried out are coordinated and aligned with the overall goals and objectives of the projects. The central point is often the Project Management Office, which oversees planning, execution and governance across the project (Ichsan et al., 2023). Furthermore, by utilising tools like the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), which breaks down large complex projects into manageable tasks (Slack, Brandon-Jones and Johnston, 2013), it enables the Harvest City team to better recognise the Intelligent Procurement System as the core deliverable. It would also provide a clear illustration that the infrastructure, timelines and resources need to be planned around the system‚Äôs requirements, instead of forcing the system to fit into an already established construction framework. Lastly, a Gantt Chart could have been developed during the early stage to provide a clear visual overview of the key project timelines, helping the team to better monitor their progress and efficiency (Slack, Brandon-Jones and Johnston, 2013). \n\nStrengthening Project Leadership and Governance Through Stakeholder Engagement and Communication\n\nTo address the issue of weak governance after the resignation of Casper, the CEO, the Harvest City Corporation should have appointed a dedicated project director (or establish PMO) with equivalent experience and similar expertise, rather than dispersing responsibilities across the executive team, in which many may lack the relevant expertise needed. This ensures continuity and consistent oversight of the project (Nixon, Harrington and Parker, 2012). Furthermore, the project director or PMO, in collaboration with Venso, could have conducted a Power-Interest Matrix to categorise stakeholders based on their level of power and interest in the project (Zhu et al., 2024). This insight would have helped the team to identify key stakeholder dependencies (Zhu et al., 2024), therefore prioritising communications, successfully managing expectations and making strategic decisions regarding stakeholder involvement. To reinforce this structure, a formal communication channel should be established to ensure that all relevant information is shared with the appropriate stakeholders in a timely and efficient manner (Galli, 2022). \n\nManaging Change and Scope Control Through Early Stakeholder\n\nEngagement and Formal Review Process To prevent the emergence of unforeseen changes, all stakeholders should have been brought in during the early planning stage, before the system and construction design finalises. Early involvement of stakeholders would have reduced the likelihood of change requests arising in the middle of the projects, as stakeholder would have had a clearer understanding of the importance of this procurement system and that it could not be easily changed after the finalisation of the system design (Prebaniƒá and Vukomanoviƒá, 2023). This would have encouraged the stakeholders like tenants and catering vendors to express their needs and requirements from the outset, allowing the project team to have sufficient time to incorporate their needs into the plan. Furthermore, the project team should have implemented a Change Control Management System. This is a structured process involving: Identifying proposed changes, evaluating their impact on the project scope, approving or rejecting the proposal, implementing approved changes and finally, monitoring the results (Team, 2024). With the implementation of this formal process, changes can be critically assessed before deciding whether they are necessary and feasible to implement. To support this, Harvest City and the project team should have established a Change Control Board (CCB) responsible for the carrying out of the process (Irfan et al., 2023).

    "text": "Education Overview\n\n\nI am a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Business Studies degree specialised in Data Analytics, from Dublin City University (DCU). I have a strong interest in the field of data analytics and is curious of how analytics can make a change to the world. During the course of my studies, I have gained knowledge on multiple business aspects including marketing, HRM, supply chain management and operations management, and had hands on experiences on several programming tools like SQL, Power BI and Python. With a strong foundation in both business and analytics field, I believe that I can bridge the gap between technical insights and strategic decision-making, ultimately contributing to more informed, efficient, and impactful business solutions.\nA recent highlight of my university journey is that I had the opportunity to participate in a Dragons Den style presentation, which provided valuable insight into the entrepreneurial process. This experience provided a hands-on introduction to developing a business idea, pitching to potential investors (i.e.¬†panels of Dragons), and navigating the challenges and creativity required to launch a new product/service. This experience was both challenging and rewarding, as it gave me a hands-on understanding of what it takes to bring an idea to life, from identifying market needs to delivering a compelling pitch. It also strengthened my skills in teamwork, communication, problem-solving, and strategic thinking.\n\n\n\n\n Internship\n\n\nAs part of my course in Business Studies, I had the opportunity to go on INTRA, a year-long internship program that provided valuable hands-on experience in a professional environment. Throughout the placement, I have developed key professional skills from building a strong CV and tackling through interviews, to working effectively in a professional environment.\nMy internship took place at Research Ireland, a funding organisation that supports researchers in the STEM fields in Ireland. I worked in the Programme Operations department, where I gained valuable, multifaceted experience across both administrative and logistical tasks. Throughout the internship, I had the opportunity to work with a range of tools, including Microsoft Excel, Word, Tableau, and the company‚Äôs grants and awards management system. This experience not only strengthened my technical and organisational abilities but also enhanced my ability to quickly adapt to new systems and workflows in a professional environment. This role has allowed me to develop a well-rounded understanding of internal operations, while also strengthening my time management skills, stakeholder engagement, and ability to adapt to a dynamic work environment. I gained confidence in both collaborative teamwork and taking individual responsibility for tasks and projects."

    "title": "E-Waste: A Problem That is Being Forgotten. A Problem That We‚Äôve All Contributed To",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I didn‚Äôt think I was part of a problem. A problem that always exists and quietly growing but being ignored and forgotten. Like most people, I get excited when I buy a new phone. But the truth is, a lot of the time, the reason for buying the new was not to replace something that‚Äôs broken, but because it‚Äôs the newer trend. Suddenly, I feel that my camera quality is not good enough. Suddenly, I want a phone with five camera lenses, even though I only ever use one, but it looks cool. Suddenly, my current phone feels old. Suddenly, these small, insignificant details have become my excuse for buying the new phone. The old phone, which still functions perfectly, is now abandoned.\nNow, what is the true cost of my irrational purchase? Was it just the money that has left my pocket? No, it‚Äôs more than that. There is an environmental cost that we‚Äôve never considered. E-wastes. 62 million tonnes of electronic wastes (e-wastes) were generated globally in 2022. That includes all disregarded electronic devices such as laptops, television, household appliances and of course, smartphones. Though a portion of these may be labelled as ‚Äòrecycled‚Äô, statistics have shown that only 22.3%, which is less than a quarter of the year‚Äôs e-waste, are actually properly recycled. The rest still ends up either in the landfills or is exported to developing countries, where devices are dismantled in informal settings. Often, this dangerous work is done by children or unprotected workers, who are exposed to toxic materials such as lead, which puts their health and lives at serious risk.\nWhat shocked me the most wasn‚Äôt this massive number of statistics, but how unconsciously I‚Äôve been contributing to this major world issue.\nWe live in a culture that subtly rewards consumption. For instance, every time when a new iPhone is released, we hear the voices and discussions about it around us, making us feel like if we don‚Äôt keep up, we are falling behind. But have we ever questioned ‚ÄúDo I really need a new phone?‚Äù, ‚ÄúIs my current one broken?‚Äù. What contributed to covering these voices are the business model that thrives on overproduction. Technology companies, driven by profit, are producing new models of a product chain more frequently now which influences consumers to purchase the new model before their current devices reach the end of their lifespan. This means that some of these phones would unnecessarily end up in the landfill.\nTake Apple, for instance, their new models in recent years have been released with minor upgrades. However, due to the psychological effect of perceived obsolescence, consumers begin to believe that older models are outdated and no longer good enough, despite the fact that they still function perfectly. Furthermore, tech companies have started pricing new models lower than the previous models, influencing consumers to purchase the newer model. This tactic leads sales to their newer product, and once sales drop in the older models, these older models are quietly pulled from the production and their focus can be placed again on developing a new model.\nAnd what if some customers resist the hype and care about durability and better functionality rather than the tech trend? That‚Äôs where planned obsolescence comes in. Planned obsolescence is a strategy where products are deliberately designed to have a limited lifespan. A common example is the battery issues. Smartphone batteries often degrade quickly and cannot be replaced easily, meaning that if the battery is worn out, the whole device would have to be replaced. Now another phone is being wasted.\nNow, back to the question, how do we, as consumers, exactly contribute to the production of e-waste other than being led by businesses? Does business take all the blame? My answer is no. Businesses cannot generate profit from a product without consumer demand. At the heart of this behaviour is a cultural force we rarely stop to question: consumerism. This is the belief that buying and owning things can bring us happiness, success and a sense of self-worth. So, the more we buy, the happier we are. This culture we live in plays a huge role in shaping the tech demands. In this culture, a phone isn‚Äôt just a phone, it‚Äôs a symbol for status, a way to stay connected, and a source of belonging. This mindset has transformed this demand from a need, to a desire. This is a key driving factor that fuels the continuous demand for new electronic devices, creating a cycle of overconsumption that ultimately leads to the growing crisis of e-waste.\nI believe the solution to this does not lie in blaming consumers or demonising businesses. The issue of e-waste is a shared responsibility. Companies respond to what we demand, and we, in turn, respond to what they produce. It‚Äôs a cycle. For decades, we have celebrated the acceleration of innovation and the evolution of technology. While that achievement is something we should definitely be proud of, perhaps it‚Äôs also time for us to pause - to recognise not only what we have gained, but also what we are losing in the process.\nMaybe the starting point for solving this issue isn‚Äôt a major policy shift, or a cease in innovation. Maybe it begins with something much simpler: us, as consumers. What if we paused before we buy, asking ourselves, ‚ÄúDo I really need this product?‚Äù, ‚ÄúIs it a need, or is it just a passing desire that will fade once a newer trend appears?‚Äù. The first step is awareness; it‚Äôs becoming more mindful of how our everyday decisions contribute to the bigger picture. And from that awareness, changes begin."

The first half of the report identifies the key factors based on the case study, contributing to the project failure, and critically examines three core issues:\n\n\nLate integration of procurement system and misalignment with the construction schedule.\nUnexpected change in leadership and absence of strong governance.\nUncontrolled scope creep and lack of formal change management process.\n\n\nThese issues have ultimately led to delays of the grand opening, reputational damage due to safety incidents, and significant financial waste. The second half of the report proposes targeted recommendations to each of the core issues. These include the adoption of centralised management and formal review process, to utilising planning and analysis tools like the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Gantt Chart, Power-Interest Matrix to effectively mitigate conflicts and control risks.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Harvest City Intelligent Procurement System project was a large-scale technology initiative designed to automate and optimise the procurement of goods and services across the Harvest City Convention Centre Complex. The system plans to integrate Internet of Things (IoT), sensors, cloud-based infrastructure and real-time analytics to manage both direct and indirect items‚Äô procurement (Applegate and Montealegre, 2018). This system was set out to improve efficiencies and reduce cost in managing the operations across all tenants. However, this project was a failure. Due to many internal and external factors, it resulted in delays, loss of finance and damage to Harvest City‚Äôs reputation. In this report, I will identify the key factors contributing to the project‚Äôs failure and critically examine three main factors. Furthermore, I will propose recommendations referencing project management principles, which could have mitigated these issues and improved the project‚Äôs chance of success.\n\n\n\nKey Factors Contributing to Project Failure:\n\n\nLate integration and misalignment with construction schedule: Venso was brought into the project after construction had already begun, meaning that a lot of the completed or in-progress interior space had to be demolished for alternation required to incorporate Venso‚Äôs procurement system.\nLeadership changes & weak governance: Leadership responsibilities were later on dispersed across executive team members without a clear handover, instead of appointing a new leader. As the team is already overwhelmed with other aspects of the project, it caused unconsidered decision-making and poor coordination.\nLack of stakeholder alignment and communication: Miscommunication about the system requirements and approvals have caused significant interruptions to the installed system.\nScope creep and poor change management: Stakeholders constantly requested for changes to the system, even after the contract clearly stated that no changes would be permitted beyond specific deadlines. The contractual agreements were treated as flexible guidelines instead of binding commitments by the stakeholders.\nInadequate project oversight: The new executive team failed to recognise the critical role of the procurement system and treated it as a conventional infrastructure project instead of a complex and integrated technology project.\n\nNow, the report will delve into three core factors. \n\nLate Integration and Schedule Misalignment\n\nOne of the core issues contributed to Harvest City Intelligent Procurement System‚Äôs failure is the late integration of the system from the very beginning. Prior to the signing of the contract, Miller, the CEO of Venso, has clearly expressed that their intelligent procurement system could not be successfully integrated midway through a construction project, due to its technical complexity and the requirement for embedded infrastructure to support the IoT, sensors and other key components. However, despite the warnings, the contract still proceeded following the persuasion from Casper. This has resulted in multiple interior spaces in the complex to be demolished and rebuilt in order to incorporate the alterations, which caused a waste of both financial and physical resources. Furthermore, due to the scheduled completion of the project being a few weeks before the centre‚Äôs grand opening, it has given the centre no time to trial run and spot any errors beforehand, causing the huge incident of the event day. \n\nLeadership Changes and Weak Governance\n\nAnother key factor contributed to the project‚Äôs failure was the ineffective response towards unforeseen leadership change. After John Casper, the CEO of Harvest City Corporation resigned from his position due to illness, instead of hiring and appointing a new leader with the relevant expertise, the responsibilities were dispersed across the rest of the executive team, who are already overwhelmed with other duties. The team not only lacked technical expertise, but also failed to dedicate sufficient time and effort to fully understand the contract and the project‚Äôs scope. Furthermore, there was a clear lack of shared vision, as the executive team saw the project as a conventional infrastructure project instead of a core complex and integrated technology project that requires specialised support. This has equipped them with no capability to make optimal and effective decisions. As a result, critical issues raised by Venso were either delayed or ignored completely, which significantly affected the project‚Äôs ability to address challenges and to remain aligned with the original plans and vision. \n\nScope Creep and Poor Change Management\n\nThe third key factor that contributed to this project‚Äôs failure was the emergence of scope creep and the lack of effective change management. Despite the system design being finalised and the signed contract clearly stating that no further changes would be permitted after specific deadlines, many tenants and internal stakeholders continued to request for modifications. For example, the operating team requested a change which required demolition and reconstruction to the space. The catering vendor requested changes that required extra financial input. These change requests disrupted the original project plan and workflow, requiring additional actions that extended beyond the planned schedule. Since the original completion date was already close to the grand opening, time flexibility for incorporating changes were extremely limited. Moreover, complaints that were made at executive levels were all ignored meaning that implementations on change requests had to proceed, even without a formal review process and assessment carried out. As a result, these changes led to misalignment to the original deadline and compromised the system‚Äôs integrity. \n\n\nRecommendations\n\n\nImproving Project Planning and Integration Through Centralised Management, WBS and Gantt Chart\n\nTo address the issue of late integration and schedule misalignment, the Harvest City Intelligent Procurement System project should establish a centralised project management structure at the early phase of the project lifecycle. This means that all project management functions such as project planning, stakeholder management are managed by one central point (Jong and Faerman, 2020). This ensures that all activities and decisions carried out are coordinated and aligned with the overall goals and objectives of the projects. The central point is often the Project Management Office, which oversees planning, execution and governance across the project (Ichsan et al., 2023). Furthermore, by utilising tools like the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), which breaks down large complex projects into manageable tasks (Slack, Brandon-Jones and Johnston, 2013), it enables the Harvest City team to better recognise the Intelligent Procurement System as the core deliverable. It would also provide a clear illustration that the infrastructure, timelines and resources need to be planned around the system‚Äôs requirements, instead of forcing the system to fit into an already established construction framework. Lastly, a Gantt Chart could have been developed during the early stage to provide a clear visual overview of the key project timelines, helping the team to better monitor their progress and efficiency (Slack, Brandon-Jones and Johnston, 2013). \n\nStrengthening Project Leadership and Governance Through Stakeholder Engagement and Communication\n\nTo address the issue of weak governance after the resignation of Casper, the CEO, the Harvest City Corporation should have appointed a dedicated project director (or establish PMO) with equivalent experience and similar expertise, rather than dispersing responsibilities across the executive team, in which many may lack the relevant expertise needed. This ensures continuity and consistent oversight of the project (Nixon, Harrington and Parker, 2012). Furthermore, the project director or PMO, in collaboration with Venso, could have conducted a Power-Interest Matrix to categorise stakeholders based on their level of power and interest in the project (Zhu et al., 2024). This insight would have helped the team to identify key stakeholder dependencies (Zhu et al., 2024), therefore prioritising communications, successfully managing expectations and making strategic decisions regarding stakeholder involvement. To reinforce this structure, a formal communication channel should be established to ensure that all relevant information is shared with the appropriate stakeholders in a timely and efficient manner (Galli, 2022). \n\nManaging Change and Scope Control Through Early Stakeholder\n\nEngagement and Formal Review Process To prevent the emergence of unforeseen changes, all stakeholders should have been brought in during the early planning stage, before the system and construction design finalises. Early involvement of stakeholders would have reduced the likelihood of change requests arising in the middle of the projects, as stakeholder would have had a clearer understanding of the importance of this procurement system and that it could not be easily changed after the finalisation of the system design (Prebaniƒá and Vukomanoviƒá, 2023). This would have encouraged the stakeholders like tenants and catering vendors to express their needs and requirements from the outset, allowing the project team to have sufficient time to incorporate their needs into the plan. Furthermore, the project team should have implemented a Change Control Management System. This is a structured process involving: Identifying proposed changes, evaluating their impact on the project scope, approving or rejecting the proposal, implementing approved changes and finally, monitoring the results (Team, 2024). With the implementation of this formal process, changes can be critically assessed before deciding whether they are necessary and feasible to implement. To support this, Harvest City and the project team should have established a Change Control Board (CCB) responsible for the carrying out of the process (Irfan et al., 2023). Conclusion In conclusion, the Harvest City Intelligent Procurement System Project demonstrates the importance of strategic and effective project management in large-scale technology and innovation-driven initiatives. The core issues of this case lies around its poor communication among stakeholders, ineffective control and coordinations, and weak leadership. This case also highlights the importance of stakeholder alignment and illustrates how decisions made in the early stage can escalate into larger issues that significantly impact the late phase of the project.

    "text": "üìÑ PDF\n\n\nExecutive Summary\nStrong Roots, an Irish plant-based frozen food company known for its healthy and sustainable frozen foods, has expanded into new markets across Ireland, UK, Europe, Asia and the US. Despite gaining a solid foothold in the global frozen food industry, it continues to face challenges that disrupt its supply chain. This essay will focus on the impact of climate change on Strong Roots‚Äô supply chain, identifying the current supply chain issues the company is facing. I will propose strategies through conducting researches, to help mitigate the climate-related challenges and outline an implementation timeline for the first year and a brief overview of implementation for second year. Finally, I will justify the proposed strategies by referencing supply chain theories and providing examples of how other companies have successfully implemented similar approaches.\n\n\nIntroduction\nStrong Roots is an Irish SME founded in 2015 which is known for producing plant-based, frozen and nutritious foods such as sweet potatoes fries, spinach bites and cauliflower hash brown. Strong Roots offers a wide range of vegan options (Strong Roots, no date) and centres its focus on producing high quality, healthy frozen foods. Starting off as a small local business, Strong Roots has now expanded its market across many countries in the UK, Europe, Asia and the US (Taylor, 2018). As the company is growing both domestically and internationally, tt must adapt its ingredients and sourcing practices to align with local food regulations and consumer preferences. Like the broader frozen food industry, Strong Roots faces challenges in logistics, material sourcing, and maintaining its sustainability goals. However, following its acquisition by McCain, the company may now have increased resources and capital to address these challenges more effectively.\n\n\nRisk Assessment ‚Äì Climate Change-Centred Supply Chain Challenges\nUnstable Agricultural Production\nStrong Roots emphasises complete transparency of its ingredients in the nutrition information provided to the customers (Strong Roots, no date). It is apparent that the company do not use any GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) as it serves its primary purpose of providing a healthier alternative to burgers, fried dishes and other frozen foods (Instacart, no date). Most of the vegetables and ingredients used by Strong Roots are sourced directly from farmers across different countries near their manufacturers. While this approach ensures the freshness and proximity of the ingredients, it poses the supply chain challenge due to unpredictable agricultural production. Extreme weather conditions such as storms, floods and droughts can interrupt crop growth and cause unexpected shortages, affecting ingredient availability (Prasad and Chakravorty, 2015).\nLogistical Disruptions\nRefrigerated foods are typically transported by sea and road to accommodate the low temperature needed to prevent the spoilage of the foods. Therefore, Strong Roots mainly relies on sea and road freights to deliver its raw materials and inventory (Global Research Consulting, 2023). For instances, the extreme lowering of water levels of some European rivers in summer 2022 (Limb, 2022) have hugely restricted the river freight capacity. This also led to an increased charge on road freights as the alternative transport option. Other conditions like extreme heatwaves can pose challenges of delaying the rail speed (Stugys, 2023) due to sun kink and raise issues of road cracking and other damage which eventually leads to an operational disruption of road freights (Stugys, 2023) which is one of the main modes of transport Strong Roots relies on. This disruption of supply chain logistics can ultimately lead to a higher cost of transportation affecting the efficiency and timeliness of inventory restocking.\nIncrease of Carbon Footprint\nOne of the main commitments of Strong Roots is to reduce carbon footprint (Strong Roots, no date). In its partnership with McCain in 2021, it can be seen that Strong Roots aligns with McCain‚Äôs commitment to sustainable practice, includes the implementing of generative agriculture (O‚ÄôSullivan, 2024). This has undoubtedly tackled a part of their sustainable goals. However, Strong Roots still faces greenhouse gas emissions challenge, mainly due to the heavy reliance on sea and road freights. As refrigerated truck are required to transport temperature-sensitive materials like vegetables (DHL Freight Connections, no date), it consumes more fuels than the standard trucks due to their cooling systems.\n\n\nProposed Strategic Plan to Tackle Climate Change Impact on Strong Roots\n\nInvestment of Hydroponics\n\nTo respond to the unstable agricultural production caused by extreme weather conditions, Strong Roots could invest into Hydroponics to ensure the stable sourcing of raw materials (i.e.¬†vegetables, etc). Hydroponics is the growing of plants using a ‚Äúwater-based nutrient solution‚Äù instead of soil (USDA, no date). With indoor hydroponics, the risk of disrupted crop production can be hugely reduced by preventing land degradation (eden green technologies, no date) and other damages and delays caused by extreme weather conditions (Rajendran et al., 2024). Hydroponics crops potentially reduce the level of contamination risk compared to soil-based farming which provides a more safe and healthy consumption (Rajendran et al., 2024) which allows the company to continue to strive its goal of providing heathy foods. While high capital is required to develop Strong Roots‚Äô own Hydroponics system, Strong Roots could leverage its acquisition by McCain Food company to explore partnerships with Hydroponic companies. Strong Roots could establish a long-term contract, securing sustainable facilities through an external partner without the immediate capital outlay of building its own system.\n\nInvestment of Vertical Farming\n\nVertical farming is the method of growing crops in vertically and horizontally stacked layers (eden green technologies, no date). In terms of addressing the climate change challenges Vertical Farming is conducted indoors and does not require soils or natural sunlight, hence it is not affected by weather conditions (Kalantari et al., 2017). Vertical Farming can also be an advantage towards countries with urban heat challenges (Kalantari et al., 2017) like the US, due to its nature of taking place indoor with artificial light source and soilless process. In terms of nutrition, produce from vertical farming does not contain any herbicides, pesticides, or artificial preservatives (Kalantari et al., 2017), aligning with the company goal of providing nutritious and healthy food options. Strong Roots can consider finding Vertical Farms in countries like the US, where such facilities are established, and develop a reliable supplier relationship to proactively prepared for weather disruptions.\n\nSupplier and Geographic Diversification\n\nAn approach to address the logistical disruption is to diversify the supplier geographically and fostering collaboration across multiple supply chain tiers. As Strong Roots have markets across different continents like the US, Europe, and Asia, the company should consider sourcing some ingredients like vegetables from different regions with less climate impact (Kittipanya‚Äêngam, Shi and Gregory, 2011). This enables Strong Roots to avoid relying on a single source of raw ingredients. For instance, when one supplier experience supply shortages, another supplier from a different region can fulfil the demand. Furthermore, Strong Roots should consider communicating and collaborating with both downstream and upstream logistics vendors. This enables the organisation to know where and how items are sourced, transported and processed, allowing it to take proactive measures to mitigate any potential risk.\n\nImplementation of Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO)\n\nWhile the approach of adopting Hydroponics and Vertical Farming have already reduced carbon emission to some extent, Strong Roots could further reduce its carbon emission by replacing fuels used by agricultural machinery or refrigerated truck, to Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO). HVO is a low-carbon biofuel which can directly replace the regular diesel and offers a more biodegradable, renewable and sustainable approach in transportation (Smigins et al., 2023). By taking this action, Strong Roots would be able to reduce the greenhouse emission significantly hence further promotes its sustainable reputation.\n\n\nImplementation Timeline\nThe following table is a suggested plan for Strong Roots for the first three years of the initial implementation of the strategies:\n\nYear 2\nIn Year 2, the company expect to have successfully secured the contract with HVO suppliers. Strong Roots should continue to maintain stable and constant communication with diverse region suppliers and should expect to secure contract in the regions that is most likely in need of alternative suppliers. Furthermore, the company should continue to look into the capital and investment side for the hydroponics system.\n\n\nJustification of Proposed Strategy\nInvesting in Hydroponics and Vertical Farming as a supply chain strategy aligns with the theory of Supply Chain Agility. Supply Chain Agility refers to the ability of a supply chain to respond quickly towards changes in supply or demand (Gligor et al., 2019). Agility focuses on efficiency and flexibility to changes in the market like consumer fluctuation (Sen, 2023) and the internal company environment, for instances, shortage of raw materials (Sen, 2023) caused by geopolitical threats or climate challenges. For instances, the supermarket chain Whole Foods Market (businesswire, 2023) partners with the vertical farm company Plenty to achieve a more sustainable approach in food (Radosavac, 2022), and also mitigating risk posed by unpredictable weather conditions. Supplier and geographic diversification relates to the Risk Pooling Theory of Supply Chain, meaning that the company distribute risk among several suppliers and geographical areas in order to mitigate the impact supply chain disruptions such as caused by extreme weather conditions (Yang and Schrage, 2009). An example of company is Nestl√© which adopted geographical diversification in their sourcing of raw materials like coffee beans in order to mitigate risk of supply shortages caused by climate disruptions (Nestl√©, no date). Lastly, the implementation of HVO follows the Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) framework (ASCM, no date).\n\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, Strong Roots‚Äô commitment to sustainability has undoubtedly an important factor in motiving it to solve supply chain challenges posed by climate change. With investment of time and capital in climate resilient sourcing, diversifying supplier and using sustainable alternatives, Strong Roots can establish a more adaptive, effective and efficient supply chain. While the performance of the strategies needs to be monitored continuously, by investing into the potential challenge, it allows Strong Roots to mitigate the likelihood of significant losses due to adverse climate conditions. This proactive approach ensures the company remains resilient and prepared for the potential disruptions.\n\n\n\n\nBibliography (Harvard 12th Ed.)\nStrong Roots (no date) Strong Roots | Our products, Strong Roots.
