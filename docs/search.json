    "text": "Hi! My name is Jia. I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Business Studies degree specialised in Data Analytics, from Dublin City University. I have a strong interest in the field of data analytics and is curious of how analytics can make a change to the world. During the course of my studies, I have gained knowledge on multiple business aspects including supply chain management and operations management, and had hands on experiences on several programming tools like SQL, Power BI and Python.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nAs part of my course, I had the opportunity to go on INTRA, a year-long internship program that provided valuable hands-on experience. My internship took place at Research Ireland, a funding organization that supports researchers in the STEM fields. I was based in the Programme Operations department, where I gained valuable, multifaceted experience across both administrative and logistical tasks. This role allowed me to develop a well-rounded understanding of internal operations, while also strengthening my attention to detail, stakeholder engagement, and ability to adapt to a dynamic work environment. Throughout the placement, I developed key professional skills from building a strong CV and tackling through interviews, to working effectively in a professional environment. I gained confidence in both collaborative teamwork and taking individual responsibility for tasks and projects.\n\n\n\n\nLanguage Skills\n\n\n\nLanguage\nProficiency\n\n\n\n\nEnglish\nNative\n\n\nMandarin\nNative\n\n\nCantonese\nLimited Working Proficiency\n\n\nGerman\nBeginners\n\n\n\n\nCV"
