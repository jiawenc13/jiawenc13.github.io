I have a strong interest in the field of data analytics and is curious of how analytics can make a change to the world. During the course of my studies, I have gained knowledge on multiple business aspects including supply chain management and operations management, and had hands on experiences on several programming tools like SQL, Power BI and Python.\nAs part of my course, I had the opportunity to go on INTRA, a one year internship where we’ve gained practical experience from building a CV, tackling through interviews, and getting offered a placement. My internship took place in Research Ireland, a funding company that funds researchers in the STEM area. I worked in the Programme Operations department, where I was able to get different multi aspects of experience from administrative tasks to logistics tasks.\nCV"
