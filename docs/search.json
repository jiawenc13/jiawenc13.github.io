Throughout the placement, I have developed key professional skills from building a strong CV and tackling through interviews, to working effectively in a professional environment.\nMy internship took place at Research Ireland, a funding organisation that supports researchers in the STEM fields in Ireland. I worked in the Programme Operations department, where I gained valuable, multifaceted experience across both administrative and logistical tasks. Throughout the internship, I had the opportunity to work with a range of tools, including Microsoft Excel, Word, Tableau and the company’s grants and awards management system, which helped strengthen my technical and organizational skills in a professional setting. This role has allowed me to develop a well-rounded understanding of internal operations, while also strengthening my time management skills, stakeholder engagement, and ability to adapt to a dynamic work environment. I gained confidence in both collaborative teamwork and taking individual responsibility for tasks and projects."
